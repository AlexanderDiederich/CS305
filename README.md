Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a consulting firm that helps companies develop individualize financial plans that will help them. We were hired to develop their public web application and make sure that it was as secure as possible so that it can deal with sensitive personal and financial data that is involved with their business. 

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I did well with identifying the vulnerabilities of the software and I did it by using static testing. Secure coding is used to prevent data theft and to keep the companies reputation intact. 

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The dependency check tool was very useful, because it saved time due to it testing to see what dependencies had vulnerabilites instead of having to check each one individully. 

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I increased security by trying to get rid of as many of the vulnerabilites as possible, and in the future I will also be using penetration testing to get a better assessment of the vulnerabilites. 

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I had to re-run the dependency check after the new dependencies were added. Other than that, unit testing and manually reviewing the code can also ensure funtionality. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I did research on the current algorithms and practices and used what I believe out of those were the most useful. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would show the employers how I was able to deal with the vulnerabilites and how I was able to get the code up and running to the point that the client would not be able to have any concerns.
